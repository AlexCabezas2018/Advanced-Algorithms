# Advanced Algorithms
Some advanced algorithms problems from the subject TAIS imparted in the Complutense University of Madrid

## Before starting:
The problems folders are divided in a .pdf file (which contains the problem itself) and a folder with the solution.
Inside this folder, you have to go (if the solution is not an ADT modification of the implementation) to the file "name-of-the-problem.cpp"
If the solution is an ADT modification of the implementation, then you have to go to the ADT header and find
the function or code inside a comment box. Finally, if the problem consists in graphs, you should go to
de "Solution.h" file inside the solution folder.
